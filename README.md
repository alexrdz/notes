## Agent Site

### 1.1

1. Hero image - Is this an absolute requirement?
   - what value does the hero provide?
   - can it be removed? if not, can it be reduced?
   - ~~ can the three sections under login be accessed without login?
     - if not, then do they need to be linked there? (can be a "what's inside" teaser if no) ~~
2. A simple message with a link back to corporate site in the hero image area can work to inform users.
3. Navigation here is fine. We may want to mimic the look and style of the top navigation with the corporate site's primary navigation. In case a user who is not an agent lands on this page, they can find their way back to the corporate site using a familiar navigation. 
4. If hero image is unnecessary in mobile view, is it necessary in desktop view? 
   - eliminating hero image can give us extra real estate for other messaging, calls to action, etc.
5. are we following the same navigation as the corporate site? or is this a discussion about pulling in content from those sections into the agent portal home page?

### 1.2

1. ​
2. Even though the EquiTrust  logo will serve as a link back to the home page, it might not be intuitive as to whether it will take the user back to corporate home page or portal home page. Or that it is a link at all. Keeping the home link in the navigation is recommended.
3. A few thoughts on this navigation menu:
   - Hover/drop downs can be problematic on mobile. 
   - If we think about a mobile-first approach, it would make more sense to have a vertical/stacked navigation without flyouts/dropdowns/expandable menus (less clicks, less opportunities to click the wrong item). So if we have a vertical navigation that slides in, can we keep it a vertical navigation on the desktop site? This can bring the added benefit of consistency.
   - The current agent portal has a vertical navigation.  Keeping a vertical navigation can help users better navigate a new or re-designed app by way of familiarity. Some users may experience frustration having to learn a new layout so keeping things the tiniest bit familiar can help ease any transitional frustration for our users.
4.  ​
5. Marketing spotlight - do we have any indication as to what gets priority on this page in regard to features? These features look as if they can compete with each other (marketing spotlight vs. the buzz). It would be helpful to prioritize so we can figure out which feature needs more attention.
   - Is there a way to get to "My favorites," "The Buzz," "marketing Spotlight" from another page? I do not see them linked in the navigation. The marketing spotlight might not need a link but My Favorites and The Buzz/Best Practices seem to be useful features that would be beneficial to users' as quick access or placement in primary navigation.
6.  ​
7. Is this drag-and-drop feature going to be supported in mobile view? Can it? Should it?
8. ​



### 2.1

1. Are FAQs frequently printed? Is this a popular or highly requested feature? If not, can the printer friendly link be moved out of the #1 spot in the list of FAQs?
2. I like that the FAQs will be categorized. 
   - Can we add a search just for FAQs? 
   - WIll all FAQs live on the same page (using anchor links to navigate) or will users jump from page to page?
     - Keeping all FAQs on the same page can provide a couple of advantages:
       - No reloading of pages and resources
       - Easy to use the default browser search
   - Can we let users ask new questions? A simple form should do.



The remainder of the sections in the wireframe need more domain knowledge. It would be beneficial for me to meet with or have access to someone actually using the agent site. This will give me more insight into agent needs in regard to the site.








# Dashboard UI Design

1. customization
   - don't try to put too much information on one page/screen
     - if there is a lot of information that needs to be on one screen, consider using tabs
2. grouping
   - there is a lot of information that is repeated, sometimes under different headings
   - we can trim down the navigation and the clutter by grouping items (e.g. "Marketing" can contain many different types of content)
     - card sorting
3. color and images
   - limit the use of color and images 
     - allows us to make the the colors we do use meaningful
       (when an agent sees the color red, it means something and it means one thing, always)
4. prioritize / customize content
   - is there content or sections of the site that agents refer to the most? or most often? 
   - we want to show useful and actionable information at a glance
     - can we make that content easily available without clicking? (e.g. can agents view their commissions on the homepage as soon as they log in? can they set the state they're licensed in as their default state?)
     - can we make the destination easier to get to? (less clicks)
     - major trends, alerts and notifications
5. reveal details as needed
   - users should have all the access they need to perform a task - no less but also no more.
   - systems like the "inverted pyramid" used in journalism can be helpful
     - split your content into 3 main areas in order of diminishing significance:
       1. most important and substantial information is at the top
       2. followed by significant details that help understand the overview given before it
       3. last, general and background information which contains more detail and allows users to dive deeper



## Meeting with Marketing

1. overview of what i've done and am doing

   1. updating and revising stylesheet
   2. identifying ways to improve workflow and build better and faster
      1. modules, widgets, etc.

2. main objectives

   1. take our styleguide, existing guidelines, assets, etc. and expand them into a more consumable and digestible format

   2. identify area where we can improve flow, speed and consistency (not here to dictate design or play devil's advocate. mainly to help us see our sites and apps from the side of the user and see how we can leverage our inside expertise and make a better product for our customers).

      i have a lot to learn and will seek direction and interject where i can in hopes that we can think things out and look at things from different perspectives.

   3. also be working on the technical side of things looking at ways to speed up our development, page rendering, code efficiency, etc.
