Icons are all SVG-based. There are only a handful of icons and it is best to use the SVG code rather than as `src` for image tags. You can add classes to the SVG tags to control size. Below are several examples of the icons in use. Each icon has a 25% width via the `.w-25` class. Width classes available are `.w-25`, `.w-50`, `.w-75`, `.w-100` with the 100% width being default. Note that widths are in percents and are relative to their parent container.
