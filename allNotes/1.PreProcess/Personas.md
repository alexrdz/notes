We have business goals we need to achieve. However, we cannot meet these goals if we are not servicing the client (if we do not satisfy the customer).  UX design is the attempt to know, understand and advocate for the user while keeping business goals in mind.

In effort to accomplish both, we need to know who our customer is and know as best as possible:

1. their goals
2. their frustrations
3. their limitations
4. their triumphs

### Personas

- Represent a major user group for our website / app
- Express and focus on the major needs and expectations of the most important user groups
- Give a clear picture of the user's expectations and how they're likely to use the site
- Aid in uncovering universal features and functionality
- Describe real people with backgrounds, goals, and values

Personas help us focus on the functionality and usability of our apps by helping us view our apps from a different perspective. As owners, we tend to focus more on business goals sometimes losing sight of user goals. As developers, we tend to focus more on the easiest way to deliver content and functionality sometimes losing sight of the easiest way to consume and make sense of the information presented through our sites and apps.

Using personas, we can better prioritize features throughout the development process. Usability.gov states, In addition they can help:

- Stakeholders and leaders evaluate new site feature ideas
- Information architects develop informed wireframes, interface behaviors, and labeling
- Designers create the overall look and feel of the website
- System engineers/developers decide which approaches to take based on user behaviors
- Copy writers ensure site content is written to the appropriate audiences
