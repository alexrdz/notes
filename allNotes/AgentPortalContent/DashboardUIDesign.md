# Dashboard UI Design

1. customization
   - don't try to put too much information on one page/screen
     - if there is a lot of information that needs to be on one screen, consider using tabs
2. grouping
   - there is a lot of information that is repeated, sometimes under different headings
   - we can trim down the navigation and the clutter by grouping items (e.g. "Marketing" can contain many different types of content)
     - card sorting
3. color and images
   - limit the use of color and images 
     - allows us to make the the colors we do use meaningful
       (when an agent sees the color red, it means something and it means one thing, always)
4. prioritize / customize content
   - is there content or sections of the site that agents refer to the most? or most often? 
   - we want to show useful and actionable information at a glance
     - can we make that content easily available without clicking? (e.g. can agents view their commissions on the homepage as soon as they log in? can they set the state they're licensed in as their default state?)
     - can we make the destination easier to get to? (less clicks)
     - major trends, alerts and notifications
5. reveal details as needed
   - users should have all the access they need to perform a task - no less but also no more.
   - systems like the "inverted pyramid" used in journalism can be helpful
     - split your content into 3 main areas in order of diminishing significance:
       1. most important and substantial information is at the top
       2. followed by significant details that help understand the overview given before it
       3. last, general and background information which contains more detail and allows users to dive deeper



## Meeting with Marketing

1. overview of what i've done and am doing

   1. updating and revising stylesheet
   2. identifying ways to improve workflow and build better and faster
      1. modules, widgets, etc.

2. main objectives

   1. take our styleguide, existing guidelines, assets, etc. and expand them into a more consumable and digestible format

   2. identify area where we can improve flow, speed and consistency (not here to dictate design or play devil's advocate. mainly to help us see our sites and apps from the side of the user and see how we can leverage our inside expertise and make a better product for our customers).

      i have a lot to learn and will seek direction and interject where i can in hopes that we can think things out and look at things from different perspectives.

   3. also be working on the technical side of things looking at ways to speed up our development, page rendering, code efficiency, etc.
